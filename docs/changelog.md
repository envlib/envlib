# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

Initial implementation (2026-07-07/08):

- **Metadata model**: the 11-field identity model with validation and normalization on assignment; permanent deterministic ids (`dataset_id`, `dataset_version_id`, `station_id`) locked by golden-vector tests and a dual-model independent review.
- **Vocabularies**: bundled controlled vocabularies (feature, variable = ODM2 ∪ envlib extensions, method, processing_level, aggregation_statistic, frequency_interval, license, CF standard names v94) with a curated `(variable, feature)` → CF standard_name mapping, user-dir overlay, and `refresh()` from the upstream APIs.
- **Catalogue**: RCG-backed discovery (`query()` with spatial/temporal/latest-version semantics, `distinct()` + plural browse properties), `validate()`, `publish()`/`register()`, `deregister()` with a shared-target guard, offline fallback to the cached index.
- Verified against live S3 (grid + station-time-series round trips) on Python 3.10–3.12.
